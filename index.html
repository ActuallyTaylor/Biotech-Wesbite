            <p class="pointParagraph">We want to bring renewable energy to the entire world. By placing solar panels on the moon we will collect solar energy and send it back to the Earth. This solar energy will be able to be sent to receiving stations across the world, allowing for anyone to have solar power.</p>

            <h1 class="pointHeader" style="font-size: 64pt;">What's the point?</h1>
            <p class="pointParagraph">Renewable energy is hard to come by on Earth. It is only available in some regions and at small quantities. The Earth itself is also not helping, it scatters about 30% of light it receives back into space leaving 70% for harvesting and capture. This reduction in sunlight is not helpful to solar panels on Earth. We need a way to better capture solar energy.</p>

        <div class="pointTextDiv right">
            <h1 class="pointHeader" style="font-size: 64pt;">What are we doing?</h1>
            <p class="pointParagraph">We will send construction robots up to the moon with supplies to construct our infrastructure. There will be two batches of robots, one for the north pole and one for the south pole. Once the robots have constructed our infrastructure, the energy collected from the solar panels will be sent to storage in large batteries. Over the course of the year these batteries will send their stored power to our array of satellites surrounding the earth. These satellites will then beam the received energy back to Earth, to our receiving stations where it will be distributed to our customers.</p>

        <div class="pointTextDiv left">
            <h1 class="pointHeader" style="font-size: 64pt;">Why the north and south pole?</h1>
            <p class="pointParagraph">We chose the north and south pole because they receive 324 days and 314 days of direct sunlight respectively. This will give us almost complete solar panel coverage all year round. This constant stream of sunlight will allow us to be sending power to the Earth anytime of the year. This is a benefit over solar on the Earth because we do not have to worry about inefficiency that come with the changing seasons.</p>

            <h1 class="pointHeader" style="font-size: 64pt;">The Business Model</h1>
            <p class="pointParagraph">We will be selling our energy to other energy companies, citizens of the world and governments. Selling to lots of groups will allow us to provide power across the world, making us one of the largest producers of stable renewable energy. Selling to governments, and other energy companies allows them to drastically reduce their spending on solar infrastructure and the costly land it takes to have a sufficient amount of panels on Earth.</p>
